        <h1>Context</h1>
        <p>The point of this game is to beat the other player by getting to 10 points first. When we created 
        this game the scoring system is a sprite that changes costume when a score is made. The randomness occurs 
        when we make the ball respawn and when it bounces off the players to make it so it can be unpredictable. 
        The game gets more difficult by adding another ball after 15 seconds in. A player loses when the other 
        player scores 10 points on them.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>We created this game because we first wanted to make a Mario game but we noticed it was complicated and 
        we would need more time. We chose this type of game because we just love balls. The two successful part 
        while developing this game is making the coding of the ball and the scoreboard. Both were complicated in 
        their own way. The two obstacles we faced was trying to make the players not run out of the map and 
        stopping the ball everytime it respawn. We were able to overcome this by adding a block that bounces the 
        player back and for the ball we did this by adding a block that stops all scripts in the sprite to reset it. 
        If we had more time we would have added levels to the game and probably make the players and the balls faster.</p>

        <h2>Algorithm</h2>
        <img src="oof.png" height="350">
        <p>I believe this algorithm is significant to the game because without this algorithm the ball would just pass
        through the players. This algorithm make it so the ball would bounces off the players and the walls. It also
        make it so the ball would stop after respawning.</p>
